Feeagh QAQC

- doobs: eliminated offsets in data due to swapping sondes by realigning to initial values in dataset, this involved substraction or addition of a constant for a particular chunk of O2 data
- doobs: set 173 obviously aberrant values NA
- par OK
- wnd OK
- wtr: for wtr22.0 set 162 obviously aberrant values NA - all other depths OK except t-chain seems to have been swapped out in September with a reduction in variability (that increased over the summer) and possibly a slight reduction in temperature
